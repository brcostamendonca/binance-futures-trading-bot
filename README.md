## Create your strategy

You can create your own strategy for your bot. The file must be placed in `src/configs`. There are some examples to help you to create the best strategy. Check the declaration file `global.d.ts` to have an overview of the possibilities you can add to your strategy. And don't forget to backtest your strategy before running it in production !

## Backtest your strategy

You can backtest your strategy by running the backtest mode. To do that, you need to:

1. Configure the properties for your backtest in `config.json`.
2. Tap the commands `npm run build:test` and `npm run test` to run the backtest.
3. When the backtest ends, it generates a log file in the folder `logs` and an html report in `reports`. You can consulting these to evaluate the performance and profitability of your strategy (note that the results in real will be a little different cause of the funding rates).

## Configure the Telegram Channel

See https://core.telegram.org/bots to configure the channel. Then, set up your bot api key to the environment variable `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and the id of the chat with `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
